Notes:
Program centers primarily around minDeletionSize() method.

Firstly, it fails fast and returns -1 in the instance it detects something is wrong. If everything appears to be right, it then uses nested loops to compare characters and add them to an ArrayList where that will be returned with the final results.

Then, there is a function to print the returned ArrayList results.
